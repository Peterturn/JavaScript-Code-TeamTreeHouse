Selectors are one of the most important and powerful parts of CSS because they identify the DOM element(s) to style. When you define a selector in your stylesheet, you're instructing the browser to match every instance of that selector in the HTML.

For example, a type selector targets an element based on its type:


p {
  color: red;
}

In the above CSS snippet, p is the selector: it selects all paragraphs — <p> tags — and changes their text color to red. Type selectors are also called element selectors because you use the element’s HTML tag as the selector.

The following selector targets every <button> element on the page and sets their font size to 36px:

button {
  font-size: 36px;
}
