:nth-child() Pseudo-class
The :nth-child() pseudo-class targets elements based on their position within a parent element. :nth-child() uses a function-like syntax that accepts a value between the parentheses. The value is referred to as an argument.

We'll focus on two common arguments: the keywords odd and even. Both select every other child element based on an odd or even position.

Select Even Elements Within a Parent
The keyword even specifies that you want to target all the even-numbered elements. For example, the selector li:nth-child(even) matches the 2nd, 4th, 6th (etc.) <li> elements within a <ul>:

li:nth-child(even) {
  color: white;
  background-color: springgreen;
}
Select Odd Elements Within a Parent
The keyword odd specifies that you want to target all the odd-numbered elements. The following selector matches the 1st, 3rd, 5th (etc.) <li> elements within a <ul>:

li:nth-child(odd) {
  color: white;
  background-color: turquoise;
}
You can also pass an integer as an argument to target a specific child element. When calculating the position of an element inside its parent, the index numbering starts at 1.

li:nth-child(3) {
  color: white;
  background-color: thistle;
}
The browser targets only the 3rd list item inside the parent <ul>.

There's a whole lot more :nth-child() can do, like use expressions to select a particular combination of child elements. You won't use those as much when selecting DOM elements with JavaScript
