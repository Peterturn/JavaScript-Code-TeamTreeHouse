/*
In this project, you'll be tackling three main things:

1. Build a collection of quotations — these are the quotes, author and other information that gets printed to the screen. You'll do this by creating a JavaScript array containing JavaScript objects — one object for each quotation.
2. Create a function that pulls one of those quotes out at random.
3. Create a function that prints that quote to the screen.
