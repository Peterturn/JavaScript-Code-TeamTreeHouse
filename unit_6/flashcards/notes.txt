hi its a good idea to put the - - save at the end of a file command to add it to your json data.

Ex: flashcards petermay$ npm install express@4.15.2 --save

Use the terminal command "npm init" to start a new project with json file in your current directory.

Use the require in your app files to use the installed modules.
